from ml_engine import EnsembleCategorizationEngine
from insights_engine import InsightsEngine
from dashboard import ModernDashboard

# In main app, add to session state
if 'ensemble_engine' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['ensemble_engine'] = EnsembleCategorizationEngine()

if 'insights_engine' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['insights_engine'] = InsightsEngine()

## 🎯 Quick Feature Test

### Test Ensemble Categorization

```python
from ml_engine import EnsembleCategorizationEngine

engine = EnsembleCategorizationEngine()

test_transaction = {
    'description': 'STARBUCKS COFFEE',
    'amount': -450,
    'date': '2025-10-12'
}

category, subcategory, confidence, explanation = engine.predict(
    transaction=test_transaction,
    historical_data=[]
)

print(f"Category: {category}, Confidence: {confidence:.1%}")
```

**Expected:** Category assigned with >50% confidence

### Test Insights Engine

```python
from insights_engine import InsightsEngine

engine = InsightsEngine()

# Create sample transactions
transactions = [
    {'date': '2025-10-01', 'amount': -1000, 'category': 'Food'},
    {'date': '2025-10-02', 'amount': -500, 'category': 'Transport'},
    # ... more transactions
]

report = engine.generate_comprehensive_report(transactions)

print("Insights:", report['insights'])
print("Recommendations:", len(report['recommendations']))
```

**Expected:** Insights and recommendations generated

### Test Dashboard

```python
from dashboard import ModernDashboard

dashboard = ModernDashboard()

# Note: This requires Streamlit context
# Best tested in the actual app
```

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Import Error

**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotly'`

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install plotly>=5.18.0
```

### Issue: Demo Fails

**Error:** Any error in `demo_advanced_features.py`

**Solution:**
1. Check Python version: `python --version` (need 3.8+)
2. Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Check file locations: Ensure all new files are in project root

### Issue: Low Categorization Confidence

**Error:** All predictions show <30% confidence

**Solution:**
- This is normal with no historical data
- Add at least 50 categorized transactions
- System will improve over time with learning

### Issue: Charts Not Rendering

**Error:** Blank space where charts should be

**Solution:**
1. Check Plotly installation: `pip show plotly`
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Try a different browser
4. Clear Streamlit cache: `streamlit cache clear`
