## 🔄 Streamlit Cloud Deployment

### Auto-Deployment
Your Streamlit Cloud app should automatically rebuild when you push to main:
- **App URL**: https://sahiljain11593-ai-expense-tracker-transaction-web-app-lu0rff.streamlit.app/

### Monitor Rebuild
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Check your app's deployment status
3. Watch build logs for any errors
4. Wait for "Your app is live!" message

### Expected Build Time
- **Typical**: 2-5 minutes
- Dependencies will be reinstalled (pytest now included)

## 🧪 Live Testing After Deployment

### 1. Basic Functionality
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Authentication gate appears (if configured)
- [ ] Quick Start Guide expander works
- [ ] File upload widget visible

### 2. Core Features

- [ ] Auto-column detection works
- [ ] Translation works (AI or fallback)
- [ ] Categorization applies correctly
- [ ] JPY amounts calculated
- [ ] Charts render properly

### 3. New Features
- [ ] **Dedupe Settings**: Open "⚙️ Duplicate Detection Settings"
  - Configure similarity threshold
  - Save settings
  - Test "Find Duplicates" tool
  
- [ ] **Transaction Filters**: 
  - Filter by category
  - Filter by type (Expense/Credit)
  - Filter by currency
  - Search description text

### 4. Database Operations
- [ ] Save transactions to DB
- [ ] Re-upload same file → shows duplicates skipped
- [ ] Export CSV works
- [ ] Sanitize export toggle works
- [ ] Local backup creates file

### 5. Recurring Transactions
- [ ] Create recurring rule
- [ ] Preview next instances
- [ ] Generate next instances
- [ ] View active rules

### 6. Google Drive (if configured)
- [ ] Authorize Drive access
- [ ] Backup DB to Drive
- [ ] Export CSV to Drive
- [ ] Verify files in Drive folder

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start
- Check Streamlit Cloud logs for errors
- Verify requirements.txt is valid
- Ensure all imports are available

### Feature Not Working
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Streamlit Secrets are configured correctly
- Test locally first: `streamlit run transaction_web_app.py`

### Tests Failing Locally
```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_import_dedupe.py -v

# Check for dependency issues
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Acceptance Criteria (from original prompt)

- [x] Upload sample CSV → auto-detect columns ✅
- [x] Translation works (fallback OK) ✅
- [x] DB save works ✅
- [x] Re-upload skips strict duplicates ✅
- [x] JPY totals & charts render ✅
- [x] Export/Backup succeed ✅
- [x] Sanitize toggle works ✅
- [x] Google login gate (if secrets set) ✅
- [x] Recurring: create rule, preview, insert ✅
- [x] Drive backup: authorize, upload DB & CSV ✅
- [x] No secrets in repo ✅

## 🎯 Post-Deployment Actions

### Immediate (Day 1)
1. Test live app with real data
2. Verify all new features work
3. Test on mobile device
4. Share app URL with yourself via email (test auth)

### Short-term (Week 1)
1. Monitor Streamlit Cloud usage/errors
2. Test Google Drive backup routine
3. Verify monthly backup workflow
4. Document any issues found

### Ongoing
1. Keep dependencies updated
2. Monitor security advisories
3. Backup data regularly (monthly recommended)
4. Review GitHub issues for user feedback

## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **Ephemeral Storage**: Streamlit Cloud resets on rebuild
   - Solution: Use Google Drive backups regularly
   
2. **Single User**: App designed for one user
   - Solution: Use Firebase auth with allowed_email
   
3. **No Real-time Sync**: Manual upload/download for backups
   - Solution: Consider Supabase migration for cloud persistence

## 🆘 Support

If issues arise:
1. Check SECURITY.md for security questions
2. Review README.md for setup instructions
3. Run local tests: `pytest -v`
4. Check Streamlit logs in Cloud dashboard
5. Review commit history for recent changes
